# Lesson
***
After setting up COSMOS on your computer, you can start the software as instructed. 

Once COSMOS is launched in your browser, click the plus button on the top left corner. Once you click the plus, you will see a dropdown menu which contains: `Import Data`, `Import RSS Feed` and `Start Twitter Collection` subitems. To import pre-existing data on COSMOS:
1. Click `Import Data`.
2. Choose between the options `drag and drop` or `browse` to import a single file into COSMOS.
3. Name the dataset and write a description by filling the form on the popup window.
![Import pre-exist Data](../fig/Import-pre-existing-data.png){:height="250px" width="500px"}
4. After filling the form and selecting the file, just hit the `import` button.
5. The imported data set appears on the `Show Panel` and it is ready to use.
![Imported Data](../fig/imported-data.png){:height="250px" width="400px"}
