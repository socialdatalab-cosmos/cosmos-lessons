# Lesson
***
After setting up COSMOS on your computer, you can start the software as it is instructed. 

Once COSMOS is launched in your browser, click the plus button on the top left corner. Once, you click the plus, you will see dropdown menu which contains: `Import Data`, `Import RSS Feed` and `Start Twitter Collection` subitems. To import pre-existing data on COSMOS:
1. Click `Import Data`.
2. Choose one of the option `drag and drop` or `browse` to import the single file to COSMOS.
3. Name the dataset and write some explanation by filling the form on the popup window.
![Import pre-exist Data](../fig/Import-pre-existing-data.png){:height="250px" width="500px"}
4. After filling the form and selecting the file, just hit the `import` button.
5. The imported data set appears on the `Show Panel` and it is ready to use.
![Imported Data](../fig/imported-data.png){:height="250px" width="400px"}
