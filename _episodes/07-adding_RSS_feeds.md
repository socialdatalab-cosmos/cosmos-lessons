### What is RSS Feed?
- RSS Feed is a technology that allows users to access updates to the website in a computer-readable format.
- Websites which publish episodes, news, blog posts or episodes of video series use RSS Feeds.
- With the RSS Feeds users do not need to check websites manually for new content.
- Further information can be found on these links below:

Once COSMOS is launched in your browser, click the plus button on the top left corner. There are options `Import Data`, `Import RSS Feed`, `Start Twitter Collection`, and `Import Classifier`. We will import pre-existing data on COSMOS:

1. Click `Import RSS Feed` and the popup window appears on the page.

2. Then, find the RSS Feed URL of the website and `copy and paste` it to the form.
3. Name the dataset and write some explanation by filling the form on the popup window.
4. After filling the form, just hit the `import` button.
5. It set appears on the `Show Panel` and ready to `drag and drop` onto the workspace.
